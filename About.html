    <h1>About X-Edge</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      An independent platform for discovering, understanding, and exploring AI tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      X-Edge was created to simplify the way people discover and evaluate AI tools.
      With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence, finding the right tools —
      without hype or confusion — has become increasingly difficult.
    </p>

    <p>
      X-Edge aims to solve this by curating and organizing AI tools in a clear,
      accessible, and transparent way.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to make AI tools easier to discover and understand — especially
      for students, creators, developers, and early-stage founders.
    </p>

    <p>
      We focus on clarity over promotion, usefulness over trends, and transparency
      over exaggeration.
    </p>

    <h2>What X-Edge Is (and Isn’t)</h2>
    <p>
      X-Edge is an independent discovery platform. We list and organize third-party
      tools for informational and educational purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are <strong>not</strong>:
      <br />• An official marketplace
      <br />• Affiliated with the tools listed
      <br />• A reseller or representative of any company
    </p>

    <p>
      All trademarks, logos, and product names belong to their respective owners.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Handle Data</h2>
    <p>
      X-Edge collects minimal data. Currently, this includes email addresses only
      when users voluntarily submit them (for updates or announcements).
    </p>

    <p>
      Email data is stored securely using Firebase (Google Cloud infrastructure),
      and we do not sell or share personal information.
    </p>

    <p>
      For full details, please review our
      <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Security & Transparency</h2>
    <p>
      X-Edge is built as a lightweight, static platform to minimize security risks.
      We prioritize safe defaults, minimal data collection, and clear communication.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the platform evolves, security and privacy practices will evolve with it.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Status</h2>
    <p>
      X-Edge is currently an early-stage project (MVP). Features, design, and content
      may change as we learn from users and improve the platform.
    </p>
